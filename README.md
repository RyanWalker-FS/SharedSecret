# SharedSecret
Description:
In this step, a config.js or secrets.json file is created to store all secrets and is committed to the repository. The app imports and uses it.

Explanation:
When this file is pushed to GitHub, the repository will include the secret.
I notice GitHub shows a security warning about exposing credentials.
This demonstrates what should not be done in real applications.
